Your task will be to build a simple weather app using React by completing some of the following prompts:

1. Basic Weather Display: Create a UI that shows the current weather conditions (temperature, description, icon) for a specific location using an API like OpenWeatherMap. Display the data in a visually appealing manner.
2. Location Search: Implement a feature where users can input a city name or zip code to get the weather details for that location. Ensure error handling for invalid inputs.
3. Forecast Display: Extend the app to show a 3 or 5-day weather forecast for the chosen location. Organize the forecast data (e.g., temperature highs/lows, weather descriptions) in a user-friendly way.
4. Responsive Design: Make the app responsive so that it looks good and functions well on different devices and screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
5. Unit Conversion: Include an option to switch between different units of measurement for temperature (e.g., Celsius and Fahrenheit). Implement this feature without refreshing the page.
6. Loading States & Error Handling: Implement loading states while fetching weather data and handle any potential errors gracefully, displaying meaningful error messages to users.
7. LocalStorage Integration: Allow users to save their favorite locations and store this data in the browser's localStorage. Enable users to view weather details for their saved locations.
